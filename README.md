## Summary
You have an iOS App. Let's imagine, we are developing an app for iOS. You could build your iOS App to handle all possible cases.

## Details
- Let's imagegine, we are developing an app for iOS. This simple iOS App using [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) 
- We expect you to come up with a two tab and four screen application. We have listed some of the UI requirements below.

- First Tab Screen 
  - You will list all the available all SpaceX Rockets.
  - You should add favorite button and you will keep up in lokal database. 
  - You can choose if you want. UserDefault, Realm, Core Data etc.
  - User must add or remove favorite rocket
  - Each item must have a thumbnail of the rocket, rocket name and rocket descritpton (if rocket has image or has description)
  - UI Design is up to developer.
  - Clicking an item will launch the rocket detail screen

- Rocket Detail Screen
  -  This screen will show all the details about a particular movie item
  -  There should be a rocket image, title description, summary etc
  -  There must be favorite button. 
  -  Show the clickable favorite button with its previous state (user selected the rocket as favorite or not)
  -  Show rocket images in a slidable gallery


- Second tab screen
  - List favorite rockets of the user
  - Each item must have unfavorite button (If user click unfavorite button UI must be reload)
  - Clicking an item will launch the rocket detail screen
 
## Solution
- Demonstrated mastery of advanced programming concepts in swift for Apple platforms, including
	- MVVM or VIP (Clean Swift) application architecture
	- Protocol-oriented programming
	- Object-oriented programming
	- Generics, Extensions
	- Class, object, and attribute privacy and access-control levels
	- The Codable protocol
	- Working with RESTful APIs & raw JSON data
	- You can use Alamofire,Moye URLSession & native networking in Swift (Moya preferred)
	- Demonstrated experience working with data structures that are relevant to the assignment
	- Strategies for proper sourcing & instantiation of interface builder .xib & .storyboard files that belong to an encapsulated framework
	- Variable autolayout traits for universal applications (iOS & iPadOS) that support all device classes & device orientations

> Protip: if you feel as though you are adding something that is listed as a goal, but you do not feel that you have a good or clear justification for where or why you are adding it, you may be adding that feature / functionality in the wrong or non-optimal part of your assignment’s codebase.
 
 **Additional Important Info**
- Check your local version of Xcode
	- The very **latest release version** of Xcode is required.
		- Beta versions of Xcode should **not** be used.
- Check your local swift version.
	- **Swift version 5.2 (or higher)** (installed with latest Xcode)
- Check your local swift-tools version.
	- **Swift-Tools version 5.2 (or higher)** is required
	- Install from [Swift.org](https://swift.org) if your local tools are not 5.2 or higher (should be by default when installing Xcode)
- The targeted iOS version for any submission should be **iOS 13.0**
	- In general, make sure to double check your project settings.
